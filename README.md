BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Q: What is the purpose of the project? 
A: To #learn about #data being communicated over the #internet. Specifically about collecting data, organizing #data, and presenting #data.

Q: Okay what is the goal? 
A: #Apple Inc. has a feature where you can view your screen time per app usage. For example, if lets say today you watched 2 hours of youtube on your iPad, then this will be logged. When navigating to /settings/screentime/ you will find a list of all the apps you opened and viewed today. The goal of this project is to see if one can collect this data, organize the data, and have it available in #real-time i.e., either through an app, your #browser.

Q: But if #apple already have this feature, why reperform it? 
A: 

(i) the settings/screentime is not too user-friendly for comparing. E.g., if one would set a #goal for coding for example, you want to code for at least 10 hours a week. Then by end of the week you will find a list of all apps used/ viewed the past week, including your coding app e.g., #VSCode. One can navigate to prior week which make it possible to see how much #VSCode hours you spend prior week, but would be included in the list of all apps. In other words, it's not setup that one can click on VSCode and see all hours spend this week, prior week etc. 

(ii) The #data is only available up to 4 weeks prior. That means hours spend on coding would be lost after 4 weeks.

Q: Okay so you want to collect the #data, and have it available in #real-time? 
A: Yes, that is the #goal.

Q: What are the first steps? 
A: 

(i) Establish a framework - > start thinking about how you would collect the data. Where you would store the #data, how you would present the #data. 

(ii) Establish a prototype - > start working on all #elements (i.e., the how, the where to store data, the medium you would use to present the #data. The #goal here is not to have a fully optimized system but rather a complete system. You want all the steps (i.e., collecting #data, storing #data, organizing #data, and having the data accessible) to be there. 

(iii) #Automate - > Once you have a prototype, then you want to start automating. The goal here is to either replace or remove a #method. The goal here is to remove/ replace #methods resulting into less #energy and or less man #hours required. As an example, at first, part of your prototype, you might manually make screenshot by navigating to setttings, screen time, and hit button screen shot. In the automation phase, you might have found a method where everyday at a preferred set time, your phone would automatically navigate to settings, then screen time, and make a screenshot. Thus, eliminating the need to manually perform this, you use less man #hours which also evidently results into less #energy used. You now have more man hours and energy for other problems to solve. 

(iv) Spot check your steps above to check for any leakages. The whole process is about solving the #problem. You want your screen time data accesible now. Meaning, fast #real-time. Whenever you want, wherever you want. If for some reason, as part of the aumotation of screenshots accidentily skip/ cut-off the last line item, then this could be a leakage. If you can live with the data knowing that one line-item is skipped evrytime, but saves you 3 minutes everyday, then this might not be a leakage. On the other hand, if you manually need to add the one line-item into your database, then this additional step would need to be done before the data is readily available. Thus, a leakage.
